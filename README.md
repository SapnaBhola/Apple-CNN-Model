# 🍎 Apple Leaf Disease Classification using CNN

A deep learning-based image classification project to detect and categorize apple leaf diseases using custom CNN architecture. Built with **TensorFlow**, **Keras**, and deployed through **Streamlit**, this project showcases end-to-end ML engineering skills from model design to deployment.

---

## 💡 Project Summary

This application classifies apple leaf images into four categories:

- Apple Scab
- Black Rot
- Cedar Apple Rust
- Healthy

It is designed to assist farmers, agriculturists, and researchers in identifying leaf diseases early for better crop management.
